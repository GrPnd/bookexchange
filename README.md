# bookexchange
Book exchange C# Web Application. In this project, I developed user based book exchange platform, where users can take available books, view owned books and give ratings to them.
Additionally, users can initiate trade requests with others, accepting or declining offers. 
This project strengthened my skills in building interactive, user-centric systems with C#.
